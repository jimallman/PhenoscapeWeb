<h2>Explanation of relationship types</h2>

<p>Various relationships and their reciprocal types are shown between anatomical structures.</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Has subtype and is a type of</dt>
	<dd>Structure B is a type of structure A. Structure A has subtypes B and C.<br>
   premaxillary tooth is a type of: tooth<br>
   tooth has subtypes: dentary tooth, premaxillary tooth, vomerine tooth</dd>
	<dt>Is part of and has part</dt>
	<dd>Structure B is a part of structure A during the time at which they both exist. Structure A may have a part B during the time at which they both exist.<br>
   premaxillary tooth is part of: premaxilla<br>
   premaxilla has parts: premaxilla ascending process, premaxillary tooth</dd>
	<dt>Overlaps</dt>
	<dd>Structure B overlaps structure A if both structures share an unnamed
	part.<br>
	hyomandibula overlaps hyomandibula-metapterygoid joint</dd>
	<dt>Develops from and develops into</dt>
	<dd>Structure A develops from structure B. Structure B develops into structure A. There can be a one to one, one to many, or many to one correspondence. For example, Structure A develops from structure B and C, or structure A develops into structure B and C.<br>
   hyomandibula develops from: hyosymplectic cartilage<br>
   hyosymplectic cartilage develops into: hyomandibula, symplectic</dd>

These relationships are representations of formal types described by the <a href="http://www.bioontology.org/wiki/index.php/RO:Main_Page">OBO-REL ontology</a>.
